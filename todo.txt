Stats:
- WAN extrapolation

Whishlist
- Stats jump when thread restarts - pause stats for 2 seconds?
- Remember last settings (IP-Address, layer, flows) + save settings into a file
- Use QHostInfo to do a DNS-Lookup on destinationHost
- dynamic port numbers per flow (would be easier for the user, only the expert needs to set the udp port?
- Pause one of the UdpEcho
- Change every parameter of flows while sending
- Resolve Hostname when tipping, and show IP that will be used
- Graph the results with QCustomPlot ! // New QGraph
- Choose DSCP from List (EF...)
- Add latency as a statistic
- Display the messed system with a possibility to calculate how much Traffic is generated by encapsulations (Example: GRE Tunnel)
- Make Packet-sending intervall Tc customisable per UDP-Sender
- Adding / removing sending threads while generating traffic (now: delete = crash)
- Tune performance:
    - 60 Mbit/s (L2) with 64-Bytes-Frames and 0,1% loss => More Threads per Flow?
    - 1 Gbit(s (L1) with 1518-Bytes-Frames, 0% loss
    - 500 Mbit/s (L2) with 512-Bytes-Frames; 0% loss => More Threads per Flow?
    - I sometimes get a small amount of packet loss, but I'm not sure were there are from.
- Pretty cool would be an osciloscope - Send the same pattern repeatidly an look at the answer (how does the network reacts on burtsts?)
- IPv6-Support - very low priority, IPv4 is fine for Network testing.
- Give the Window a name, not "MainWindow" :-)
- Generate traffic and Stop traffic should be one button, wich changes its label (And color?). The "Idle" Status must be updated

- Filter on source IP Address
- Filter on destination IP Address (avoid to respond to broadcasts with a broadcast source IP)
