TODO:
- Adding a thread - no receiving bandwidth
- Changing PDU Size changes the bandwidth

Whishlist:
- Stats jumps when thread restarts - pause stats for 2 seconds?
- Remember last settings (IP-Address, layer, flows) + save settings into a file
- Pause one of the UdpEcho
- Change every parameter of flows while sending
- "Ping" Saellite (udp echo port 7/UDP)
- When Destination is in the same VLAN and does not respond (no ARP Reply), the sending bandwidth is not 0
- Graph the results with QCustomPlot // New QGraph
- Choose DSCP from List (EF...)
- Add latency as a statistic
- Display the tested system with a possibility to calculate how much Traffic is generated by encapsulations (Example: GRE Tunnel)
   - WAN extrapolation
   - The encapsulations sould be customisable
- Make Packet-sending intervall Tc customisable per UDP-Sender
- Tune performance / multiple threads per flow
- Pretty cool would be an osciloscope - Send the same pattern repeatidly an look at the answer (how does the network reacts on bursts?)
- IPv6-Support - very low priority, IPv4 is fine for network testing.
