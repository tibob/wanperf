Multithreading:
- add change TOS-parameter (restart thread)
- make wanperfd multithread
- current performance:
    O 100 Mbit/s at 64 Bytes Frames. (Tuned sysctl net.core.rmem_default / sysctl net.core.rmem_max)
    O 1 Gbit/s at 1500 Bytes Frames whitout tuning of linux, but 1 microsec sleep
      o alternate read an write for each packet.
      o I want to tune QAbstractSocket::ReceiveBufferSizeSocketOption and QAbstractSocket::SendBufferSizeSocketOption. Set it to 500000000 ? Be root :-(

- When Sending Traffic you should not be able to edit UDP-Port Number an DSCP-Value (as remote is not accessible)
 o Also change Column color

- DSCP
 o Have Qt change their code or inherit QUdpSocket

Whishlist
- Handle Errors while connecting
- dynamic port numbers per flow (would be easier for the user, only the expert needs to set the udp port?
- Differentiate IPv4 from IPv6 when calculating the UDP-bandwidth to be send
- Pause one of the UdpEcho
- Change Parameters of flows while sending (disable port change)
- Update Status of UdpEcho when Sending / Paused
- Resolve Hostname when tipping, and show IP that will be used
- disconnect when quit
- Sending (and echo) must run in a separate thread
- Optimise sending algorithm.
- Handle TOS (Sending in wanperf)
- Why can't I go beyond 100 Mbit/s? Is there an overflow in the Udp stack?
    o it seems that the responder has to be optimised - currently based on signals
- Graph the results qith QCustomPlot !
- Choose DSCP from List (EF...)
- Do not start Connection when no flow ist defined
- Do no start Connection when UDP-Port is the same on two flows
- Add latency as a statistic
